# AIM:
      To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data set.
      
# EXPLANATION:
  The primary aim with exploratory analysis is to examine the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies to direct specific testing of your hypothesis.
  
# ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Import the required packages to perform Data Cleansing,Removing Outliers and Exploratory Data Analysis.

STEP 2: Replace the null value using any one of the method from mode,median and mean based on the dataset available.

STEP 3: Use boxplot method to analyze the outliers of the given dataset.

STEP 4: Remove the outliers using Inter Quantile Range method.

STEP 5: Use Countplot method to analyze in a graphical method for categorical data.

STEP 6: Use displot method to represent the univariate distribution of data.

STEP 7: Use cross tabulation method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between multiple variables.

STEP 8: Use heatmap method of representation to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis.
